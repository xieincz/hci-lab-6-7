### Solution proposal
**Interactive Learning Modules: Enhancing Student Engagement**

To address the challenge of enhancing student engagement with educational videos, we propose the implementation of interactive learning modules within the short videos. These modules can include quizzes, polls, and reflective pauses strategically placed throughout the video content.

- **How it Works:**
  - Instructors can integrate interactive elements such as multiple-choice questions, polls, or reflective prompts at key points in their videos.
  - Students actively participate by answering questions or sharing their thoughts through the platform interface.
  - Immediate feedback is provided based on their responses, reinforcing learning and maintaining active engagement.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Active Participation:** Encourages students to actively engage with the content rather than passively consuming it.
  - **Assessment Opportunities:** Provides instructors with real-time insights into student comprehension and areas that may need further clarification.
  - **Personalized Learning:** Allows for adaptive learning experiences based on individual student responses.

This solution not only transforms students into active participants but also offers instructors valuable insights into the effectiveness of their teaching methods. By incorporating interactive elements, we not only enhance engagement but also contribute to a more dynamic and effective learning experience on the platform.
